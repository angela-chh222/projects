<h2>Reviews:</h2>
<p>The movie is a lot like 1995's Clueless, which was also totally cute, in that it has a brain and a heart. And like its heroine, it's a lot smarter than it looks.<br><b>Christy Lemire</b><br><i>Associated Press</i></p>

<p>Likable. Enjoyable. Funny. Entertaining. You'll smile. You'll laugh. You'll even root for the blonde. And yes, it is acceptable to put your resume on pink paper.<br><b>Debbie Lynn Elias</b><br><i>Behind The Lens</i></p>

<p>A cut (and style) above other comedies of this ilk, Legally Blonde mainly succeeds because of Witherspoon's winning performance.<br><b>Matt Brunson</b><br><i>Film Frenzy</i></p>
